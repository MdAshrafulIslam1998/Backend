## question:
In this [docker beginner video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo) its explained, that different stacks may depend on different libraries and dependencies and that this can be handled with Docker.

However, I don't get what the difference should be between a library and a dependency. As I see it, a library is a collection of code/packages and a dependency is a library that the database/webserver/tool depends on.

So is there any difference? Or is saying "a database relies on specific libraries and dependencies" the same as "a database relies on specific libraries" ?
