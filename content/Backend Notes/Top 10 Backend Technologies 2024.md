Backend development focuses on managing the ****server-side functionalities**** and implementation with tasks like ****designing APIs****, dealing with various components, etc. Moving ahead, in this article, we’re going to discuss some of the best technologies that are being used by backend developers.

First thing first, let’s understand the basics of back-end development.

## What is Backend Development?

Whenever you use any application or website, the components that are not visible from the front eye i.e. the logic behind contents or pages are being developed and managed by a ****back-end developer****. However, they are responsible for handling 3 major components:

- ****Server****
- ****Database****
- ****Logic****

Supporting this, all the functionality of any app or website works as it should.

## Top Backend Technologies

Now, let’s find out some of the best ****backend technologies**** that you should know while starting your career in ****back-end development****. Below here is the ****backend technologies**** list:
