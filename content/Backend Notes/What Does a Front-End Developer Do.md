## What does a front-end developer do? 

Front-end developers create user interfaces (UI). UI is the graphical layout of an application that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look. "I've always found crafting polished user interactions that surprise and delight users to be the most rewarding and engaging task," says Mari Batilando, a software engineer at [Meta](https://www.coursera.org/meta). "In order to do this, you need to both have an eye for detail and a rock-solid understanding of the platform."

### Front-end vs. back-end: What's the difference?

What's the difference between a [front-end developer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer) and a [back-end developer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-back-end-developer)? **Back-end developers** work to develop the behind-the-scenes portions of a website or application, like data storage, security, site performance, or other server-side functions.

## How to become a front-end developer

A career as a front-end web developer can flex your creativity and problem-solving skills. As a field that is constantly evolving to incorporate new technology, front-end development can reward those who like to learn new things and face challenges. The next few sections outline some of the most prominent skills for front-end developers.

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

These three languages are essential to anyone who wants to work in front-end development.

- **HTML (hypertext markup language):** The basic building block needed to develop websites; a language that allows you to make notes in digital documents that are different from regular text.

- **CSS (cascading style sheets):** The language used to create the layout, color, and overall style of the pages you create with HTML.

- **JavaScript:** The programming language that determines what the page will do.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to determine the look and functionality of the page. 

**How to get started:** If you want to learn HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, consider enrolling in an online course like [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers from John Hopkins University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers). You'll build the foundational knowledge you need to start a career in web development while earning a certificate for your resume.

### Frameworks

Frameworks are platforms for developing software consistently, efficiently, and accurately. They are tools required for JavaScript and CSS to perform the way you want them to. Having a solid understanding of them is crucial for creating page structures.

**How to get started:** To brush up on your knowledge of popular web development frameworks, consider learning from an industry leader. For example, you can enroll in the [Django Web Framework online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework) taught by the staff at Meta.

### Developer tools and software

Software like version control, which tracks and controls changes in your source code, is critical. It allows you to make changes to your code without starting over. Understanding how to use various software development tools is a building block to a successful career. 

**How to get started:** [The Software Design Methods and Tools course by the University of Colorado](https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-design-methods-tools) is an excellent way to expand your knowledge of software development tools. It's 100% online and self-paced.

### Workplace skills

In addition to understanding the technology that drives a website, having specific non-technical (or soft) skills can make you a better candidate for becoming a front-end developer. Here are a few you’ll want to keep in mind:

- Creativity
- Problem-solving skills
- Written and verbal communication skills
- Teamwork
